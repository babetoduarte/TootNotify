TootNotify - Version 1.0.0b
by: Jorge A. Duarte - babetoduarte@gmail.com
July 11, 2023

This is a python command line utility, which is able to send direct messages to
a provided user on Mastodon. To use this tool you will need to have a Mastodon
API application created, with its corresponding API credentials.

By default, the 'credentials.py' file is not shipped with the project, and must
be created by the user, populating the required variables for API access:

    # Instance url (e.g. https://mastodon.social)
    api_base_url = ""
    # API Client Key
    client_id = ""
    # API Client Secret
    client_secret = ""
    # API Access Token
    access_token = ""
    # Default recipient for the private toots (e.g. @account@mastodon.social)
    DEFAULT_RECIPIENT=""

Among the variables, a DEFAULT_RECIPIENT can be configured, so that when using
TootNotify systematically to notify the same user, the recipient address doesn't
have to be provided every time.
